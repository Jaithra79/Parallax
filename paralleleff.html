            <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2></div>
            <p class="text">Biking, or cycling, is a versatile and popular activity that encompasses a wide range of experiences and disciplines. Whether as a leisurely ride through scenic landscapes or a competitive sport demanding peak physical fitness, biking offers something for everyone.

                For leisure cyclists, biking provides an opportunity to explore nature trails, urban parks, and countryside roads at a comfortable pace. It allows individuals to connect with their surroundings, enjoying fresh air and the freedom of movement on two wheels. Cyclists often appreciate the sense of serenity and mindfulness that biking can bring, as well as the chance to escape the hustle and bustle of daily life.
                
                For sports enthusiasts, biking includes various disciplines such as mountain biking, road cycling, BMX, and track cycling, each with its own challenges and thrills. Mountain biking takes riders off-road, navigating rugged terrain and obstacles like rocks, roots, and steep descents. Road cycling focuses on speed and endurance, often involving long-distance rides on paved roads or challenging climbs up mountainsides.
                
                Competitive cycling events, from local races to prestigious international competitions like the Tour de France, showcase the athleticism and strategy required in the sport. Cyclists train rigorously to improve their strength, stamina, and technique, often working with coaches and teams to optimize performance.
                
                Beyond recreation and sport, biking plays a significant role in transportation, providing a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to cars and public transit in urban areas. Cities around the world are increasingly investing in bike-friendly infrastructure such as bike lanes, bike-sharing programs, and bike racks to encourage cycling as a practical mode of transportation.</p>

                    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2></div>
                    <p class="text">Surfing is a thrilling water sport that involves riding ocean waves using a surfboard. It's a blend of athleticism, skill, and connection with nature, attracting enthusiasts worldwide to coastal regions with ideal wave conditions.

                        The sport's origins date back to ancient Polynesian cultures, where surfing held spiritual and communal significance. Today, surfing has evolved into a global phenomenon, celebrated for its physical challenges and the exhilaration of riding waves.
                        
                        Surfing begins with paddling out into the surf zone, where surfers wait for the right wave. Wave selection is crucial, considering factors like size, shape, and speed. Timing and positioning are critical as surfers paddle furiously to catch the wave's momentum and propel themselves onto its face.
                        
                        Once on the wave, surfers use their balance and skill to maneuver across the wave's face, performing turns, cutbacks, and occasionally aerial tricks. The goal is to stay ahead of the wave's breaking point and ride its energy as far as possible.
                        
                        Surfing is more than just a sport; it's a lifestyle deeply rooted in ocean appreciation and environmental awareness. Surfers often develop a profound respect for the sea and its ecosystems, becoming advocates for marine conservation.
                        
                        The culture of surfing is characterized by camaraderie, creativity, and a love for the outdoors. Surf communities worldwide share a passion for the sport, influencing fashion, music, and art with their laid-back, coastal vibe.
                        
                        Competitive surfing showcases top athletes in events like the World Surf League (WSL), where surfers compete on renowned breaks worldwide. However, many surfers enjoy the freedom and joy of recreational surfing, seeking out waves that suit their skill level and personal style.
